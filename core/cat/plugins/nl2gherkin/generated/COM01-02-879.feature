Here is the generated Gherkin scenario:

Feature: Diagnostic Window Activation for MCU
  As a diagnostic system
  I want to ensure that the Diagnostic Window for MCU is activated when specific conditions are met

Scenario: Activate Diagnostic Window for MCU
  Given NNetworksResponseValidZc1(bit3) is True
  And Quick response time has elapsed
  And NFaultUnlatchRequestMCU is latched at 0x0
  And a message from neMotorROutboard is received
  When these conditions are met
  Then Diag Window MCU should be Enabled
